# Like A Boss

This is a fork of [fuck yeah](http://fuckyeah.herokuapp.com) from [Zach Holman](http://github.com/holman).

## Usage

You can try the online demo at [likeaboss.herokuapp.com](http://likeaboss.herokuapp.com) or you can clone the git repo, create a new heroku app and deploy it. It will work out of the box, like a boss!

## Example

Let's search for nyan cat using the online demo:

[http://likeaboss.herokuapp.com/nyan%20cat](http://likeaboss.herokuapp.com/nyan%20cat)

or... maybe search for Stalone:

[http://likeaboss.herokuapp.com/stalone](http://likeaboss.herokuapp.com/stalone)

## Known issues

- Some search keywords make the app crash ...
- Some photos are returned with the text cutted in the border...
- Some photos don't return text at all...

Yeah, this is not perfect, sometimes the app just crashes and stuff. I'll be working on it, or maybe not. Feel free to send pull requests :)
